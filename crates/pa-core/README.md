# pa-core

The session engine.

## Scope
MCP host side (`mcp/`): auth gating for built-in integrations (the
disabled-skill overrides and `/mcp list` status), the `mcpServers` settings
seam, and the `mcp.*` host-request handlers the kernel's generic MCP
client reaches through (`mcp.config`, `mcp.refresh`, optional
`mcp.begin_login`). The OAuth flow lives behind it (`oauth*` submodules:
RFC 9728 discovery, dynamic registration, PKCE, the local callback
server, token refresh; `login.rs`: login execution that persists the
endpoint-bound credential into the shared auth store and the
`wire_begin_login`/`McpOAuth` refresh integration hosts wire). The MCP
protocol itself runs kernel-side (Python
stdio/HTTP); the engine never spawns MCP servers. Tools (bash, edit, ipython + internal rename/stdout), file mutation queue, truncation and rendering rules, RLM kernel lifecycle (IPython spawn/execute/revive), skills loading, system prompt assembly, compaction, harness refinement, settings/config, package manager (npm/git/local source install/remove/list/update against settings), session manager (persist/resume). Autonomous mode
(`autonomous`): runtime state with limit normalization, continuation and
gate-failure texts, shell quality gates with retry windows and git
worktree snapshotting, and the `AutonomousDriver` policy trait a turn
loop consults after every settled turn (the engine holds no autonomous
logic of its own). The RLM recursion host seam
(`session_engine::rlm_host`): the trait the kernel's `rlm.spawn`/
`rlm.create_session`/`rlm.list_subagents`/`rlm.collect`/
`rlm.delete_subagent` host requests call into, with the roster/collect/
selector-error vocabulary the daemon implements over the supervisor link.
Platform wall (`platform`): process control (signals/process groups), file locking, file permissions, and shell selection - every OS-specific behavior in the engine lives there behind cfg-gated implementations (the durable-write rename primitive is pa-telemetry's `rename_onto`, re-exported as `platform::rename_onto`). Scheduled jobs (`cron`, the `AgentCronJobStore` port of `core/cron-jobs.ts`): file-backed job state under session artifacts (`scheduled-jobs.json` partitions) with cross-process locking, plus the public read-only scan (`cron::store::read_scheduled_jobs_artifact`) the update flow's roster projection and boot re-arm read. Tools (bash, edit, ipython + internal rename/stdout), file mutation queue, truncation and rendering rules, RLM kernel lifecycle (IPython spawn/execute/revive), skills loading, system prompt assembly, compaction, harness refinement, settings/config, package manager (npm/git/local source install/remove/list/update against settings, plus `resolve()`: precedence-ranked session resource resolution over configured packages, settings arrays, auto-discovery, and bundled skills), session manager (persist/resume). Extension host (stage 1: Node sidecar process lifecycle - spawn/handshake/ping/orderly shutdown, NDJSON RPC client + framing, host script materialized content-addressed under <agentDir>/extension-host/; stage 2: module loading with vendored jiti 2.7.0 + pi API/import shims in the sidecar, registration landing in the registry mirror (first-wins tools, command collision suffixing, flag/shortcut rules), the `ExtensionRunner` facade, extension tools bridged into the loop tool surface over `tool_execute` RPC, session-engine assembly with prompt-guideline injection; docs/extensions-runner-design.md). Extension-runner stages 3-6 are descoped (operator decision 2026-09-17); the landed stages 1-2 remain as harmless machinery. origin/main

Provider resilience policies in `session_engine`: the shared quick-retry
policy (TS `provider-retry.ts`: permanent-kind classification,
Retry-After-aware capped delays), the interactive auto-retry loop, and the
provider-failover driver (when a provider exhausts its quick retries and
another configured provider serves the same model, the failed turn
re-routes to the next provider in catalog order; the TS
`auto_retry_start`/`reason: "backup"` event vocabulary surfaces the
progression). The drivers are pure decision logic: the host (pa-daemon)
owns the attempt, the wait, and the model switch.

Session HTML export (`export_html`): the standalone viewer file for
`/export` and `session export` - the embedded product template
(assets/export-html, vendored marked/highlight.js attributed in its
NOTICE.md) plus the theme-to-CSS resolution over the bundled theme data
(pa-types) and custom themes under `<agent-dir>/themes/`, the tools
section mapping (`tools_section`: the session's tool registry to the
template's name/description/parameters list), and the custom-tool
pre-render pipeline (`ToolHtmlRenderer`/`pre_render_custom_tools` +
`ansi_to_html`: the exporter walks the entries, the session layer's
renderer produces line-oriented output, ANSI converts to inline-styled
HTML at the export step), and the two entry points
(`export_session_to_html` for the daemon worker's `export_html`
command, `export_from_file` for the CLI). Terminal theme rendering stays
pa-tui's; tool renderers live with the session's tool surface (extension
renderers cannot cross the sidecar - docs/extensions-runner-design.md);
the share-viewer flow (gist creation) is the caller's.

## Non-goals
No provider HTTP (pa-ai), no loop policy (pa-agent), no daemon supervision (pa-daemon), no TUI (pa-tui). No update coordination (the pa-cli coordinator owns the FSM; the update-flow seam here is the daemon-free support layer: `update::version` (semver/channel policy), `update::install` (the managed install-root layout), `update::release` (the channel manifest fetch), `update::download` (sha256-verified archive download + staging) - spec `docs/update-flow-state-machine.md`). Event emission at the session seams, ctx-action binding, slash-command dispatch at the product surface, and reload/stale-ctx semantics are design stages 3+ (docs/extensions-runner-design.md); the package manager installs sources and resolves resource paths only.

## Public API
`SessionEngine` (message in -> events out), `export_html` (the HTML exporter plus its renderer seam: `tools_section`, `pre_render_custom_tools` + `ToolHtmlRenderer`/`RenderedToolHtml`/`RenderedToolResult`, and `ansi_to_html::ansi_lines_to_html`/`tool_render::trim_rendered_result_lines` for renderer implementers), `ToolRegistry`, kernel manager, settings (`SettingsManager`), packages (`packages::PackageManager` + source types), extensions (`extensions::ExtensionRunner` + the sidecar RPC client + the registration registry), `platform` (process control, file locking, permissions, shell selection - usable by higher crates, e.g. pa-cli's detached spawn), `session_engine::rlm_host::RlmSubagentHost` (implemented by pa-daemon for supervisor-backed children; the default is no children), `mcp::McpManager` (the session's host-side MCP manager, exposed as `SessionEngine.mcp_manager`: auth gating for built-in integrations, the `mcpServers` setting seam, and the `mcp.*` host-request handlers - `mcp.config`/`mcp.refresh`/optional `mcp.begin_login` - the kernel's generic MCP client resolves through), `mcp::McpManager::connection_roster` + `mcp::McpConnectionEntry` (the `/mcp` view's roster: every resolved integration with its connected state, display kind, transport, and generic-listable flag), `SessionEngine::mcp_tool_listing` (the `/mcp` view's per-server tool listing through the session kernel: ensures the kernel, then the runtime `mcp_status` request - one entry per server with its tools or the failure text), `models` (the registry and resolver, plus `models::order_for_picker`: the picker-catalog order the composition root applies to its snapshot), `session_engine::provider_adapter` (`switchable_stream_fn`/`ProviderTarget`: the live provider-target slot a host swaps on `set_model`; the adapter bridges the loop's abort into pa-ai's `StreamOptions::signal` cancellation token, so a turn abort cancels the in-flight HTTP fetch at the transport — closed by `ModelStream::close` and the stream's drop), `session_engine::ipython_state` (the post-compaction `ipython_state` kernel-persistence notice: the `CompactionKernelProbe` view of the kernel provisioner the engine wiring binds via `AgentSession::set_kernel_state_probe`, and the notice row that rides `CompactRun` for the surfaces to broadcast). `session_engine::session_commands` (the `/compact`/`/refine`/`/goal`/`/autonomous` executor: the durable echo/result rows with their persistence order - the echo ahead of the command so its own work sees it - the compaction/refinement/goal/autonomous arms, and the post-execution live-context rebuild that keeps the rows in the agent state; hosts own the wire surface), `session_engine::auto_refine_trigger` (the compact-trigger auto-refine machine on `AgentSession`: the arm/discard/increment accessors and `consume_compact_auto_refine`, the shared gate/review/stamp sequence every scheduling surface applies - TS `_compactAutoRefinePending`/`_lastAutoRefineReviewAt`/`_assistantTurnsSinceAutoRefine` plus `_maybeAutoRefine`'s compact arm, the serialized checkpoint's compact step, and dispose's serialized drain, with the surface parameter carrying the one behavioral difference between a boundary and a disposal). `session_engine::goal_boundary` (the goal arms of the natural turn end on `SessionEngine`: the `--goal` construction seed with its next-turn context row - TS `_pendingNextTurnMessages` on `AgentSession` - the usage accounting, the budget-limit steer mint, the natural continuation mint with its slot rollback, and the terminal-error finish; the transports - the print driver's in-loop hook, the ACP settle loop, the daemon worker's queue - drive the one goal driver through these methods). `SessionEngine::expand_skill_submission` + `AgentSession`'s prompt-path expansion (the `/skill:<name>` submission seam, TS `_expandSkillCommand`: `skills::expand_skill_command` builds the `<skill ...>` block over the shared `pa_types::skill_blocks` parse, the accepted-turn row and the admitted user message agree on the expanded text, and the `skill used` adoption event reports from the admission). All subsystem internals `pub(crate)`; the engine is the only facade - subsystems must not import each other directly (the package manager consumes the public settings API only).

## Depends on
pa-types, pa-ai, pa-agent (one-way).
